          The wheel is come full circle. Harp not on that. I will no longer
          endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it. A fool, a
          fool! I met a fool i' th' forest, A motley fool. Invest me in my
          motley; give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through
          Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, If they will patiently
          receive my medicine. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and
          bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
          Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth.
          <br /><br />
          Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler? If he fail of
          that, He will have other means to cut you off; I overheard him and his
          practices. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you; I thought that
          all things had been savage here, And therefore put I on the
          countenance Of stern commandment. Last scene of all, That ends this
          strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
          Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing. Now in respect it
          is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the
          court, it is tedious.
          <br /><br />
          Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. By the pricking of my thumbs,
          At one fell swoop For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or, to
          speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you that
          keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling
          of an ox? His horses are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
          with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end
          riders dearly hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but
          growth; for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound
          to him as I. To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him
          as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the
          brook that brawls along this wood! To the which place a poor
          sequest'red stag, That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, Did
          come to languish; and, indeed, my lord, The wretched animal heav'd
          forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
          Almost to bursting; and the big round tears Cours'd one another down
          his innocent nose In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, Much
          marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the
          swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. If he fail of that, He will
          have other means to cut you off; I overheard him and his practices. A
          fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest, A motley fool. But whate'er
          you are That in this desert inaccessible, Under the shade of
          melancholy boughs, Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time; If
          ever you have look'd on better days, If ever been where bells have
          knoll'd to church, If ever sat at any good man's feast, If ever from
          your eyelids wip'd a tear, And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
          Let gentleness my strong enforcement be; In the which hope I blush,
          and hide my sword. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the
          nurse's arms; Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel And
          shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.
          <br /><br />
          Neither a borrower or a lender be. That's meat and drink to me, now.
          This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife. Come, sing; and you that
          will not, hold your tongues. Last scene of all, That ends this strange
          eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion; Sans
          teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
          <br /><br />
          The game is up. He has eaten me out of house and home. This woman's an
          easy glove, my lord; she goes of and on at pleasure. Let me love him
          for that; and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the Duke.
          No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess, Though in thy youth thou
          wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow. Last scene
          of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second
          childishness and mere oblivion; Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste,
          sans every thing. But look to it: Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he
          is; Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living Within this
          twelvemonth, or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory.
          Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree. I'll graff it with you,
          and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest
          fruit i' th' country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and
          that's the right virtue of the medlar.
